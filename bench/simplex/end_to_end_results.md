# Simplex end-to-end acceptance

The runner includes MPS parsing, canonical CSC construction, and a complete
simplex solve. HiGHS 1.14.0 is run with serial simplex and presolve disabled.
Times below are one ReleaseFast smoke run and are diagnostic, not stable
performance claims.

`sc105` exposed an FT construction error: `captureEp` applied historical row
corrections after solving the current mutable `U^-T`. The correction was then
counted again by the next update. Separating the pure mutable-U solve from full
BTRAN fixes the default run; a pre-ratio-test `B*aq-a` check remains as a
backward-error safety gate.

The `brandy` pivot hook showed that the default FT and reinvert-after-every-
pivot oracle now have an identical 1025-event prefix. Earlier divergences at
iterations 50 and 541 were unstable Bland leaving pivots and are prevented by
a direction-scaled pivot threshold. The remaining failure is common to both
factorization paths after a long sequence of zero-step Phase-I pivots, so its
next investigation boundary is anti-cycling/Phase-I state rather than FT.
